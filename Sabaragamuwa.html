		<h4> 01. pinnawala elephant orphanage</h4>
		<img id="img" src="Resources/pinnawala.jpg" alt="pinnawala" title="Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage">
		<p>Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, is an orphanage, nursery and captive breeding ground 
			for wild Asian elephants located at Pinnawala village, 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast
			 of Kegalle town in Sabaragamuwa Province of Sri Lanka. Pinnawala has the largest
			  herd of captive elephants in the world. In 2011, there were 96 elephants, 
			  including 43 males and 68 females from 3 generations, living in Pinnawala.

			The orphanage was founded to care and protect the many orphaned unweaned 
			wild elephants found wandering in and near the forests of Sri Lanka. 
			It was established in 1975 by the Sri Lanka Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC).
			
			On 31 August 2021, a 25 year old elephant named Surangi gave birth to 
			twin male baby elephants at the orphanage. It also marked the first 
			instance of the birth of twin elephants in Sri Lanka after a gap of 80
			 years since 1941.</p>

		<h4>02. bopath ella falls</h4>
		<img src="resources/bopath ella.jpg" alt="bopath ella" title="Bopath Ella Falls" id="img">
		<p>Bopath Ella is a waterfall situated in the Ratnapura District of Sri Lanka. It has a shape very
			 similar to the leaf of the Sacred fig or "Bo" tree, which has earned it this name. The waterfall 
			 is a major tourist attraction in the country. Local myths say that it is haunted and that it 
			 hides a treasure trove. Bopath Ella is located in a village named Agalwatte in Kuruwita in the 
			 Ratnapura District of Sri Lanka. The name "Bopath Ella" has been given to the waterfall because
			  of its shape. The water flows through a narrow gap in the rocks and then widens, forming the
			   shape of a leaf of a "Bo" tree which is the Sinhalese name for sacred fig (Ficus religiosa).
			    "Path" means leaves of a tree and "Ella" means waterfall. Virgin forests with a rich 
				biodiversity surround the waterfall. Bopath Ella is 30 metres (98 ft) high. It is formed
				 from the Kuru Ganga, which is a tributary of the Kalu Ganga. Its mean rate of flow is 6
				  square metres (65 sq ft) per second, and its catchment area receives an average rainfall
				   of 5,080 millimetres (200 in) annually. Water from the falls is used for paddy cultivation.
				    Bopath Ella is also the most comprehensively studied waterfall in the country.</p>

		<h4>03. sri padaya</h4>
		<img src="resources/adams peak.jpg" alt="adams peak" title="Adam's Peak" id="img">
		<p>Sri padaya is a 2,243 m  tall conical mountain located in central Sri Lanka. It is well known for the Sri Pada , i.e.,
			 "sacred footprint", a 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) rock formation near the summit, which in Buddhist tradition is held to be
			  the footprint of the Buddha, in Hindu tradition that of Hanuman or Shiva, i.e., "Mountain of Shiva's Light", and in
			   some Islamic and Christian traditions that of Adam, or that of St. Thomas. The mountain is located in the southern 
			   reaches of the Central Highlands in the Ratnapura District and Nuwara Eliya district of the Sabaragamuwa Province and
			    Central Province lying about 40 km  northeast of Ratnapura and 32 km  southwest of Hatton. The surrounding region is
				 largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain is a wildlife 
				 reserve, housing many species varying from elephants to leopards, and including many endemic species. Access to 
				 the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte,
				  Mookuwatte and Malimboda. The Nallathanni and Palabaddala routes are most favored by those undertaking the climb, 
				  while the Kuruwita-Erathna trail is used less often. These trails are linked to major cities or town by bus,
				   accounting for their popular use. The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte and Malimboda routes are seldom used, but do 
				   intersect with the Palabaddala road midway through the ascent. The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent
				    via Hatton and descent via Ratnapura. Although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of
					 the other trails by approximately five kilometers.</p>

		<h4>04. maha saman devalaya</h4>
		<img src="resources/saman dewalaya.jpg" alt="saman devalaya" title="Maha Saman Devalaya" id="img">

		<p>Maha Saman Devalaya or the Great Saman Temple (also called Sumana Saman Devalaya) is a shrine dedicated to deity Saman, situated
			 at Ratnapura, Sri Lanka who is the presiding deity of the Sri Pada Mountain  which is also called Samanthakuta
			  meaning the mountain of Saman which is believed to have the left foot impression of Buddha which he kept in his visit to Sri Lanka. 
			Considered as one of the guardian gods of Sri Lanka, Deity Saman is deeply venerated in the region of Rathnapura and related 
			areas in the province of Sabaragamuwa of Sri Lanka, he is recorded to have been a district administrator of the region 
			contemporary to Buddha who he met on the former's visit to Sri Lanka.
			It is believed after the demise of Saman, his clan of Deva started to venerate him by erecting a shrine for him. And it's
			 believed there had been a Temple called Saparagama Viharaya, in the same premises in the Anuradhapura era of Sri Lanka, 
			 as it's mentioned in Mahavamsa that monks from the said temple attended to the opening ceremony of Ruwanwelisaya of King
			  Dutugamunu.</p>

		<h4>05. belilena cave</h4>
		<img src="resources/belilena cave.jpg" alt="belilena cave" title="Belilena Cave" id="img">
		<p>Belilena is a well known large cave in Sri Lanka, located 8 km (5.0 mi) from the town of Kitulgala. Evidence of prehistoric
			 human presence as early as 32,000 years ago was recorded at the site. The skeletal remains of ten individuals were
			  discovered by Paul E. P. Deraniyagala, who attributed them to Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis). Balangoda
			   Man is assumed to have lived as early as 32,000 years ago and occupied high altitude territories of up to 2,000 ft 
			   (609.6 m) above sea level.
			The part of the cave beyond the lake that fills it a short way from its mouth still remains unexplored. A visit to the 
			site requires the use of a rope or rope ladder.
			
			From 1978 to 1983 the site was scientifically excavated and researched by the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.
			 Rich assemblages of cultural, faunal and human remains were discovered. The results of radiometric dating confirmed 
			 deposits of cultural material from 30,000 to 9,000 years before present. These materials include bone tools, evidence 
			 of the use of fire and geometric microlithic stone tools which, at 30,000 years old are of remarkable age. The site also
			  yielded numerous remains of game animals, such as Sambar deer, Wild boar, Indian muntjac, several monkey species, 
			  porcupines, Indian giant squirrels and a large number of local reptiles and fish. Small mammals, aquatic and tree snails
			   were prominent in the diet of Balangoda man, as were edible parts of plants such as wild breadfruit and the Kekuna nut.</p>
