	<h3>introduction about western province</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The Western Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative
		 division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have 
		 any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established
		  provincial councils. The province is the most densely populated province in the country
		   and is home to the legislative capital Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as well to Colombo, 
		   the nation's administrative and business center.</p>

		<h4> 01. Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara</h4>
		<img src="Resources/western/Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara.jpg" alt="Kelaniya" id="img" title="Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara">
		<p>The Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara or Kelaniya Temple is a Buddhist temple in Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. It is located 11 km 
			(6.8 mi) north-east of Colombo. The current chief incumbent (chief priest) is Venerable Professor Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkhitha Thera.

			The temple has often been associated with the rise and fall of Ceylon / Sri Lanka, with the popular saying that as the Kelaniya temple rose,
			 Sri Lanka rose and as it fell, the country and its administration fell. It has thus had a deep association with the political powers of the country.
			
			It is also infamous for Mapitigama Buddharakkitha, the chief conspirator of the 1959 assassination of Ceylon's fourth Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. 
			Buddharakkitha was the chief incumbent (chief priest) of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara from 1947 to 1959.
			Buddhists believe the temple to have been hallowed during the third and final visit of the Buddha to Sri Lanka, eight years after gaining enlightenment.[4] Its history would thus
			 go back to before 500 BCE. The Mahawansa records that the original Stupa at Kelaniya enshrined a gem-studded throne on which the Buddha sat and preached. The temple flourished 
			 during the Kotte era but much of its land was confiscated during the Portuguese empire. Under the Dutch empire, however, there were new gifts of land and under the patronage of 
			 King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha the temple was rebuilt. It was refurbished in the first half of the 20th century with the help of Helena Wijewardana.</p>

		<h4> 02. independence square</h4>
		<img src="resources/western/z_p43-Splendour1.jpg" alt="independence square" id="img" title="independence square">
		<p>Independence Memorial Hall (also known as Independence Commemoration Hall) is a national monument in Sri Lanka built for commemoration of the independence of Sri Lanka from the British rule 
			with the restoration of full governing responsibility to a Ceylonese-elected legislature on February 4, 1948. It is located in Independence Square (formerly Torrington Square) in the Cinnamon
			 Gardens, Colombo. It also houses the Independence Memorial Museum.

			The monument was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurred at a 
			special podium February 4, 1948.
			
			Located at the head of the monument is the statue of the first prime minister of the country Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake "The Father of the Nation". Most of the annual National Independence 
			Day celebrations have been held here. Apart from a monument it served as the ceremonial assembly hall for the Senate of Ceylon and the House of Representatives of Ceylon until the parliament was
			 moved to the new parliament complex. Currently it is the venue for religious events and annual national day celebrations.</p>

		<h4> 03. Galle Face Green</h4>
		<img src="Resources/western/a8.jpg" alt="Galle Face Green" title="Galle Face Green" id="img">
		<p>Galle Face is a 5 ha (12 acres) ocean-side urban park, which stretches for 500 m (1,600 ft) along the coast, in the heart of Colombo, the financial and business capital of Sri Lanka. The promenade
			 was initially laid out in 1859 by Governor Sir Henry George Ward, although the original Galle Face Green extended over a much larger area than is seen today. The Galle Face Green was initially
			  used for horse racing and as a golf course, but was also used for cricket, polo, football, tennis and rugby.
			  The Galle Face Green is currently a 5 hectare ribbon strip of land between Galle Road and the Indian Ocean which is now the largest open space in Colombo. This is a popular destination for children, 
			  vendors, teenagers, lovers, kite flyers, merrymakers and all those who want to indulge in their favorite pastimes next to the sea under the open sky. On Saturday and Sunday evenings, the land is 
			  busy with day trippers, picnickers and food vendors selling cooked crabs and prawns, slices of mango with pepper and salt.[2] There are two large hotels that border the strip; the Ceylon 
			  Inter-Continental Hotel and at the other by the quaint Galle Face Hotel, one of Sri Lanka's oldest and most popular hotels, with a variety of old world charm including old furniture,
			   hand carved doors, balconies and high ceilings. It is also used as the site for Sri Lanka's national day celebration held annually on 4 February.
			   Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, the oldest radio station in South Asia, has recorded many programs here from their outside broadcast input in 
			   the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

			 open all year long and can be reached by public transportation. Diversity of the zoo is indicated by the presence of an aquarium, walk through aviary, reptile house, butterfly garden
			  and many small, dilapidated cages and enclosures, housing starving, bored animals, living in prison-like conditions.

			 The zoological garden has a small, but picturesque butterfly garden which is decorated with small shrubs, trees, creepers and small streams. Internal temperature and humidity of the
			  house is controlled by artificially created mist. The butterfly garden exhibits 30 species of butterflies with their all stages of life cycle for educational purposes.</p>
