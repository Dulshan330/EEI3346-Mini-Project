	<h3>introduction about north central province</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>North Central Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, 
		the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces 
		have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status
		 until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka
		  established provincial councils. The province is the largest by
		   size, and second least populated in the country. The province 
		   consists of the districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, both 
		   of which were important ancient Sri Lankan kingdoms. The climate
		    is semi-arid, and the forests are dry evergreen forests.</p>

		<h4> 01. Sri Maha Bodhi</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north central/Sri Maha Bodhi.jpg" alt="Sri Maha Bodhi" title="Sri Maha Bodhi" id="img">
		<p>
			Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi  is a sacred bo tree in the Mahamewna Gardens, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is the southern branch from the historical Sri Maha Bodhi at 
			Buddha Gaya in India under which Buddha attained Enlightenment. It was planted in 288 BC, and is the oldest living human-planted tree in the world 
			with a known planting date. Today it is one of the most sacred relics of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka and respected by Buddhists all over the world.

The other fig trees that surround the sacred tree protect it from storms and animals such as monkeys, bats, etc.

In April 2014, the government banned all construction within 500 metres (1,600 ft) of the tree. Only construction that obviously will not harm the tree will be allowed.
Buddhists on the Island have had a practice of visiting and paying homage to the most sacred Bodhi tree. It is an annual custom for pilgrims from far-away villages to visit 
the city of Anuradhapura and to pay homage to the Sri Maha Bodhi. The caretaker of this site provides various offerings on a daily basis. The Buddhists in general have a strong 
belief that offerings made to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi have produced significant and positive changes in their life. It has also been customary for many Buddhists to make a special
 vow before the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi for the safe delivery of their babies without malformations and for many other cures. It has also been a long tradition among farmers around 
 Anuradhapura to offer the Sri Maha Bodhi tree the rice prepared from their first paddy harvest. They strongly believe that such offerings lead to a sustained paddy production with
  the least sufferings from drought as well as pest attacks, including elephant damage.

		<h4> 02. Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north central/Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya.jpg" alt="Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya" title="Polonnaruwa Gal Viharaya" id="img">
		<p>The Gal Vihara, and originally as the Uttararama, is a rock temple of the Buddha situated in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa in North Central Province, Sri Lanka. It was 
			fashioned in the 12th century by Parakramabahu I. The central feature of the temple is four rock relief statues of the Buddha, which have been carved into the face of a 
			large granitic (granite gneiss) rock. The images consist of a large seated figure, another smaller seated figure inside an artificial cavern, a standing figure and a reclining 
			figure. These are considered to be some of the best examples of ancient Sinhalese sculpting and carving arts, and have made the Gal Vihara the most visited monument at Polonnaruwa.

			The images of Uttararama follow a different style from the images of the previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image
			 is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have 
			 been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to
			  have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist
			   priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.</p>

		<h4> 03. Minneriya National Park</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north central/Minneriya National Park.jpg" alt="Minneriya National Park" title="Minneriya National Park" id="img">
		<p>Minneriya National Park is a national park in North Central Province of Sri Lanka. The area was designated as a national park on 12 August 1997, having been originally declared as a 
			wildlife sanctuary in 1938. The reason for declaring the area as protected is to protect the catchment of Minneriya tank and the wildlife of the surrounding area. The tank is of 
			historical importance, having been built by King Mahasen in third century AD. The park is a dry season feeding ground for the elephant population dwelling in forests of Matale, 
			Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee districts. The park earned revenue of Rs. 10.7 million in the six months ending in August 2009. Along with Kaudulla and Girithale, Minneriya forms one 
			of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of Sri Lanka.The park is situated 182 kilometres (113 mi) from Colombo.
			The area is situated in dry zone of Sri Lanka and receives an average rainfall of 1,500–2,000 millimetres (59–79 in). The lowest temperature and highest of the park are 20.6 °C 
			(69.1 °F) and 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) respectively. The main sources of water for the tank are a diversion of Amban River and Elahera canal. The wet season lasts during the north 
			eastern monsoon from October to January and from May to September considered as the dry season</p>

		<h4> 04. Nissanka Latha Mandapaya</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north central/Nissanka Latha Mandapaya.jpg" alt="Nissanka Latha Mandapaya" title="Nissanka Latha Mandapaya" id="img">
		<p>Nissanka Latha Mandapaya  is a unique structure in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka. A màndapa is a pillared structure that is open on all 
			sides and protects the person(s) inside from the sun with a roof. By definition, as of the 20th century, mándapas, as temporary structures, are built inside a house or a building
			 and serve as recitation platform during remembrance ceremonies for the dead.

			Built by King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196) and named after him, it is located near the western entrance of the Dalada Maluva, the area that contains the oldest and most sacred
			 monuments in the city. A nearby stone inscription identifies this as the building used by Nissanka Malla to listen to pirith (chanting of Buddhist scriptures).
			
			The structure is an elevated stone platform with a number of stone columns and surrounded by a low stone wall. These stone columns are the unique feature about the Nissanka Latha
			Manadapaya, since they are carved in a manner that is found nowhere else in the country. The eight granite columns are arranged in two rows, with four in each row.[2] Presumably 
			used to support a roof, each of them is approximately 8 feet 4 inches (2.54 m) in height. In each of these columns, the crown is carved in the shape of a blossoming lotus bud. 
			The rest of the column is elaborately carved to resemble the stem of the flower. Unlike stone columns commonly seen in the architecture of this period, these are not straight,
			 but are curved in three places. According to archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana, the stone columns at the Nissanka Latha Mandapaya are the best examples of this feature of ancient 
			 Sri Lankan architecture.</p>

		<h4> 05. kala wewa</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north central/kala wewa.jpg" alt="kala wewa" title="kala wewa" id="img">
		<p>Kala Wewa built by the King Datusena in 460 A.D, is a twin reservoir complex (Kala Wewa & Balalu Wewa) which has a capacity of 123 million cubic meters. This reservoir complex has 
			facilitated with a stone made spillway and three main sluices. From the central major sluice, a 40 feet wide central conveys water to feed thousands of acres of paddy lands and ends
			at the historical capital Anuradhapura city tank Tissa Wewa meandering over 87 km (54 mi) at a slope of 6 inches per mile and is another wonder of primeval hydraulic engineering facility 
			in ancient Ceylon.
			This reservoir was built by the King Dhathusena who ruled the country during 455 – 473 CE in the 5th century.

			Tamil invaders who arrived from South India ruled the north part of the country during the period from 429 to 455 AD. King Dhathusena defeated the invaders and united the country and then 
			he wanted to rebuild the irrigation system by constructing several tanks, canals, etc., in and round the kingdom of Anuradhapura.
			
			After completion of construction of Kala Wewa, the king built another tank called Balalu Wewa  nearby and connected the two tanks together making the biggest tank in Sri Lanka.
			 King Mahinda II who ruled the country during 777 – 797 CE expanded the tank further. Water of the tank was transferred to the Thisa Wewa in Anuradhapura by an ancient 54 miles
			  (86.9 km) long canal called Jaya Ganga alias Yodha Ela which has a fine slope of one foot per mile but according to some historians it is one inch per mile.</p>
