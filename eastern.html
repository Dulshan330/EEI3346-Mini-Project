	<h3>introduction about esatern province
	</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The Eastern Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, 
		the first level administrative division of the country.
		 The provinces have existed since the 19th century but
		  did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th
		   Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established
		    provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province
			 was temporarily merged with the Northern Province to
			  form the North Eastern Province. The capital of the
			   province is Trincomalee.</p>

		<h4> 01. Marble Beach </h4>
		<img src="Resources/eastern/Marble Beach.jpg" alt="Marble Beach" title="Marble Beach" id="img">
		<p>Marble Beach is a beautiful and clean beach situated in Kinniya Road, Trincomalee. This pristine sandy beach is excellent for relaxing and the sea is ideal for swimming.
			 The famous Marble Beach Air Force Resort managed by the Sri Lanka Air Force is also located here. Marble Beach is also known by the name of Marble Bay Beach and is one 
			 of the most beautiful beaches of Sri Lanka. The name “Marble Beach” is derived from the fact that when the sea is calm on a clear and bright day, the surface can be seen 
			 to be shining like marble. This calm and beautiful beach is relatively untouched and remains to be clean with pristine clear blue water. The sea here is also popular for
			  snorkelling due to the existence of large schools of coloured fish.
			  From Trinco take the Trincomalee highway and go past China Bay and Clappenburg to reach the Marble Beach.</p>

		<h4> 02. Fort Fredrick</h4>
		<img src="Resources/eastern/Fort Fredrick.jpg" alt="Fort Fredrick" title="Fort Fredrick" id="img">
		<p>Fort Fredrick also known as Trincomalee Fort or Fort of Triquillimale, is a fort built by the Portuguese at Trincomalee, Eastern Province, Sri Lanka, completed in 1624 CE, 
			built on Swami Rock-Konamamalai from the debris of the world-famous ancient Hindu Koneswaram temple (Temple of a Thousand Pillars). The temple was destroyed by the Portuguese
			 colonial Constantino de Sá de Noronha under Phillip III, occupier of the Jaffna kingdom and Malabar country on the island. On the Konamalai cape was also built a new village of 
			 Portuguese and Tamil people, 50 Portuguese soldiers and inside the fort, a church named after "Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe". The Fort of Triquillimale was dismantled and rebuilt 
			 by the Dutch in 1665, renamed Fort Fredrick.
			 Several Hindu shrines in the Tamil country were destroyed during the occupation, particularly under Philip II, when Trincomalee became the scene of naval battles during Europe's 
			 Thirty Years' War. King Ethirimana Cinkam of the Jaffna kingdom had resisted a call by D. Jerónimo de Azevedo in 1612 to aid the latter in building a fortress in Trincomalee. The 
			 enterprise was abandoned. With the defeat of King Cankili II, all of the territory of the kingdom of Jaffna, comprising Trincomalee and Batticaloa, was assigned to the "spiritual 
			 cures of the Franciscans." This decision was taken by the bishop of Cochin, fray Dom Sebastião de S. Pedro. By the end of 1619, a small Danish fleet had arrived at Trincomalee; 
			 in May 1620, the Danes occupied Koneswaram temple and began works for the fortification of the peninsula before being defeated.</p>

		<h4> 03. Shree Thirukoneswaram Kovil</h4>
		<img src="Resources/eastern/z_p13-Koneshwaram.jpg" alt="Shree Thirukoneswaram Kovil" title="Shree Thirukoneswaram Kovil" id="img">
		<p>Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee or Thirukonamalai Konesar Temple – The Temple of the Thousand Pillars and Dakshina-Then Kailasam is a classical-medieval Hindu temple complex in Trincomalee,
			 a Hindu religious pilgrimage centre in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the reign of the early Cholas and
			  the Five Dravidians of the Early Pandyan Kingdom on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna bay and the Indian Ocean. Its Pallava, Chola, Pandyan and 
			  Jaffna design reflect a continual Tamil Saivite influence in the Vannimai region from the classical period. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Eiswara, shortened
			   to Konesar. Connected at the mouth of the Mahavilli Ganga River to the footprint of Shiva at Sivan Oli Padam Malai at the river's source, the temple symbolically crowns the flow of the Ganges
			    River from Shiva's head of Mount Kailash to his feet.

			Developed from 205 BC, the original kovil combined key features to form its basic Dravidian temple plan, such as its thousand pillared hall – "Aayiram Kaal Mandapam" – and the Jagati expanded by 
			King Elara Manu Needhi Cholan. Regarded as the greatest building of its age for its architecture, elaborate sculptural bas-relief ornamentation adorned a black granite megalith while its multiple
			 gold plated gopuram towers were expanded in the medieval period. One of three major Hindu shrines on the promontory with a colossal gopuram tower, it stood distinctly on the cape's highest eminence.</p>

		<h4> 04. Batticaloa Fort</h4>
		<img src="Resources/eastern/Batticaloa_Portuguese_(dutch)_fort.jpg" alt="Batticaloa Fort" title="Batticaloa Fort" id="img">
		<p>Originally a Portuguese settlement, the Fort of Batticaloa was first constructed in 1628 as a trading and administrative center. Set upon a small island, the fort protrudes into a swampy lagoon, 
			surveying the brackish waters protected by the city’s outer banks. The Dutch had arrived in 1602, drawn to the prospects of trade and the abundance of pepper and cinnamon grown by the local
			 community. However, it was not until King Rajasinghe in Kandy urged Dutch intervention that the European colonial power took action, capturing the fort in 1638 and establishing sovereignty 
			 in the region. Bordered by a moat on two sides and the lagoon on the others, the stone fort remained in Dutch hands for nearly two centuries before the British entered the country in the late
			  18th century and took control of the Dutch fortifications. The site has significant religious implications dating back to the 1st century B.C., evidenced by a Buddhist stupa and shatra from 
			  the Ruhuna Kingdom that remains in the area. Sea erosion, insufficient funding, encroaching development, and the tsunami of 2004 have all conspired to damage the structure and its surrounding 
			  fortifications. Further, ethnic violence that has rocked the island for much of the last 30 years has prevented conservation efforts while dividing communities and threatening security in the
			   area. However, plans to open the fort for public use can help unite the community and have the potential to further promote the fort as a religious and historic symbol.</p>
