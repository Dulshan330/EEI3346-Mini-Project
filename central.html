	<h3>introduction about central province </h3>
	<hr>

	<p>The Central Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first
		 level administrative division of the country. (The provinces have existed 
		 since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when 
		 the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial
		  councils.) The Central Province is primarily in the central mountainous
		   terrain of Sri Lanka. It is the 6th largest province by area and is home
		    to 2.5 million people. It is bordered by North Central Province to the
			 north, Uva Province to the east, North Western Province to the west
			  and Sabaragamuwa Province to the south and west. The province's capital is Kandy.

		The cities of Matale and Nuwara Eliya are in the Central Province.
		 The province is famous for its production of Ceylon tea, planted by 
		 the British in the 1860s after a devastating disease killed all the 
		 coffee plantations in the province. The Central Province attracts many 
		 tourists, with hill station towns such as Gampola, Hatton and Nuwara Eliya.</p>

		<img src="Resources/central/Lake Gregory.jpg" alt="Lake Gregory" title="Lake Gregory" id="img">
		<p>Lake Gregory, sometimes also called Gregory Lake or Gregory Reservoir, is a reservoir in heart of the tea country hill city, Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka.
			 Lake Gregory was constructed during the period of British Governor Sir William Gregory in 1873. The lake and the surrounding area make up the Gregory Lake Area.
			 In the heart of hill country, Gregory Lake is a extremely popular place with both foreign tourists and locals. This is a place to enjoy cool weather. Gregory Lake, is 
			 a reservoir in hill city, Nuwara-Eliya, Sri Lanka. 
			
			 Lake Gregory was reconstructed and thus it is now turned into a more like Lake Park which includes many recreational activities. The people who visit this place can go
			  on watersports like jet skis, windsurfing, swan-shaped paddle boats, water-walking balls, windsurfing, normal boat rides, pony rides and so much more fun activities.
			 The area was originally a swampy bog at the foot of the small hills that border the town. In 1873 Sir William Gregory authorised the damming of the Thalagala stream, 
			 which originates from Mount Pidurutalagala, in order to make more land available for the expansion of the town. 

			 In 1913 the waters of the lake were directed into a tunnel which flows to a hydro power station at 'Blackpool' between the town and Nanu Oya. The power station continues 
			 to supply electricity to the town to this day.</p>

		<img src="Resources/central/pidurangala-temple-sri-lanka.jpg" alt="Pidurangala Royal Cave Temple" title="Pidurangala Royal Cave Temple" id="img">
		<p>Pidurangala Vihara is an ancient Buddhist temple situated in Pidurangala village of Matale District, Sri Lanka. The temple was constructed on a massive rock called Pidurangala,
			 which is located a few kilometers north of the historical fort Sigiriya.
			 The temple was said to be panchavasa, consisting of five main ritual buildings. Among the buildings are Ancient Stupa, Chapter House, Image House, Bodhighara, Preaching hall, 
			 Sangharama (Bikku Residence Building) and inscriptions with drip ledged caves can be seen.
			 It is believed that the history of Pidurangala Vihara goes back beyond to the first and second century BC. From those days Pidurangala was used as a Buddhist monastery and but
			  became a prominent place during the reign of King Kashyapa (473 - 495 AC).
			 According to ancient chronicles, Prince Kashyapa had killed his father King Dhatusena and fled to Sigiriya to find out a more secure place to prevent retaliation attacks from his
			  half-brother, Mugalan. With the arrival of King Kashyapa, the Bhikkus who were meditated there were requested move to the nearby Pidurangala. In a sort of compensation,
			   King Kashyapa refurbished the temple and made it a prominent place.</p>

			  three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres (23,000 sq ft). Depictions on

			Ibbankatuwa near the Dambulla cave complexes.</p>
