	<h3>introduction about southern province</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The Southern Province of Sri Lanka is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, 
		the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have
		 existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 
		 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial 
		 councils. It is the 7th largest province by area and is home to 2.5 million
		  people, the 3rd most populated province. The province is bordered by Sabaragamuwa 
		  Province and Uva Province to the North, Eastern Province to the Northeast,
		   Western Province to the Northwest and the Indian Ocean to the South, West
		    and East. The Province's capital is Galle.

		The Southern Province is a geographic area consisting of the districts
		 of Galle, Matara and Hambantota. Subsistence farming and fishing is the
		  main source of income for the vast majority of the people of this region.
		   Government School education is primarily handled by the Southern Provincial 
		   Education Department.</p>

		<h4> 01. Galle Dutch Fort</h4>
		<img src="Resources/southern/Galle Dutch Fort.jpg" id="img">
		<p>Galle Fort in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. 
			It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by 
			Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.

			The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties 
			inside the fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world. The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed
			 as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South 
			 Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."
			
			The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area Galle town. It has been since restored.</p>

		<h4> 02. Hikkaduwa Beach </h4>
		<img src="Resources/southern/hikkaduwa beach.jpg" alt="Hikkaduwa Beach" title="Hikkaduwa Beach" id="img">
		<p>Hikkaduwa is one of the best surfing spots in Sri Lanka, offering a clear hot water base. The waves vary in size from 4 to 11 feet. Surfing in the Hikkaduwa area is fairly well known and gets 
			the best surfing during its dry season, which is from November to March. There are 4 hotspots in Hikkaduwa. Scuba diving and diving in clear waters are a major past time along this stretch and 
			is the most ecological way to see the colorful fish that dart around. The coral sanctuary along the coast of Hikkaduwa is a large shallow body of water surrounded by a reef, decorated with layers 
			of multicolored corals, and is home to countless colorful fish. Off the beach there is a collection of small islets surrounded by beautiful coral formations. Many species of fish and large turtles
			 are found here. There are more than four different shipwrecks for diving enthusiasts to explore as well as diving shops offering PADI courses and equipment

			The beaches are beautiful and wide and swimming is safe here, although the currents are stronger when it comes south of Hikkaduwa.
			 The impressive coral reef lies just offshore and is still populated with exotic fish and sea turtles. Glass bottom boats are available for visitors who want to admire the wonders of deep while keeping
			  their feet dry! After a short distance south of the center of the reef, it decreases and begins a wider sandy beach with good waves ideal for board surfing and body surfing. </p>

		<h4> 03. Sinharaja Forest Reserve</h4>
		<img src="Resources/southern/Sinharaja_Rain_Forest.jpg" alt="Sinharaja Forest Reserve" title="Sinharaja Forest Reserve" id="img">
		<p>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

			According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them 
			are considered rare. 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds.
			
			The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere 
			Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.
			
			Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. There are about 3 elephants, and 15 or so leopards. The most common larger mammal 
			is the endemic purple-faced langur.
			
			Birds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka Crested Drongo and the noisy orange-billed babbler. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species 
			all occur here, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.</p>

		<h4> 05. Katuwana Fort</h4> 
		<img src="Resources/southern/Katuwana Fort.jpg" alt="Katuwana Fort" title="Katuwana Fort" id="img">
		<p>Katuwana Fort is an inland fort constructed by the Dutch in 1646.[1][2]


			1736 Map of Fort Catuna
			The Dutch generally built forts along the coastal areas to protect strategic harbours and anchorages from other colonial forces, such as the Portuguese. They did however construct some forts inland, 
			primarily to defend the coastal lowland areas from attacks by the Kingdom of Kandy. Katuwana fort was built approximately 40 km (25 mi) from Matara, in the Kandyan foothills at the northern limits
			 of the Dutch East India Company's territory.
			
			The fort was located on the slope of a hill, with 5 m (16 ft) high ramparts, a single gateway and a 4 m (13 ft) walkway on top. It was diagonal in shape, with two bastions, which each accommodated 
			six cannon, as a result it was often described as a redoubt rather than a fort.
			
			In 1761 during the 'Matara Rebellion' the fort was captured by Kirti Sri Rajasinha's Kandyan forces and partly destroyed. Following the anexure of the Kandy Kingdom by the British in 1815 the fort
			 lost its strategic value and was abandoned.</p>
