	<h3>introduction about northern province</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The Northern Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, 
		the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces
		 have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status 
		 until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka
		  established provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province
		   was temporarily merged with the Eastern Province to form the North 
		   Eastern Province. The capital of the province is Jaffna. The majority 
		   of the Sri Lankan Civil War was played out in this province.</p>

			<h4> 01. Nallur Kandaswamy Temple (Nallur Kovil)</h4>
			<img src="resources/northern/nallur-kovil-jaffna.jpg" alt="nallur-kovil-jaffna" id="img" title="Nallur Kandaswamy Temple (Nallur Kovil)">
			<p>Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil  is a significant Hindu temple, located in Nallur, Northern Province, Sri Lanka. The presiding deity is Lord Murugan in the form 
				of the holy 'Vel' in the Sanctum, the primary shrine, and in other forms, namely, Shanmugar, Muthukumaraswami, Valli Kaanthar with consorts Valli and
				 Deivayanai, and Thandayuthapani, sans consorts in secondary shrines in the temple. The fourth and the present temple was constructed in 1734 A.D. during 
				 the benign Dutch colonial era by 'Don Juan' Ragunatha Maapaana Mudaliyar, who served as a Shroff in the Dutch Katchery, in a place identified then as the
				  'Kurukkal Valavu. Krishnaiyar a Brahmin, served as the first priest of the temple.

				 Initially, the temple was built using bricks and stones and had a cadjan roof, enshrining a 'Vel' in the middle. The original shrine had only two small halls.
				 The temple hosts the annual festival which begins with the hoisting of the Holy flag the Kodiyetram. The cloth for hoisting is ceremonially brought to the
				  temple in a small chariot from a family belonging to the Sengunthar Kaikola Mudaliyar dynasty, for centuries.</p>

			<h4> 02. jaffna fort</h4>
			<img src="resources/northern/Jaffna_Fort_Sri_Lanka.jpg" alt="fort" id="img" title="Jaffna Fort">
			<p>Jaffna Fort is a fort built by the Portuguese at Jaffna, Sri Lanka in 1618 under Phillippe de Oliveira following the Portuguese invasion of Jaffna. The fort is 
				located near the coastal village of Gurunagar. Due to numerous miracles attributed to the statue of Virgin Mary in the church nearby, the fort was named as
				 Fortress of Our Lady of Miracles of Jafanapatão (Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora dos Milagres de Jafanapatão). It was captured by the Dutch under Rijcklof van Goens 
				 in 1658 who expanded it. In 1795, it was taken over by the British, and remained under the control of a British garrison till 1948. As the only large military
				  fort in the country, due to the presence of only government and military buildings within its ramparts, it was garrisoned by a detachment of the Ceylon Army.
				  With the onset of the Sri Lankan Civil War it came under siege on several occasions and was the scene of pitched battles. From 1985 to 1995 it was under the 
				  control of the LTTE during this time the LTTE destroyed several of key features to stop the Army getting control due to the site being used to stage attacks 
				  but it was recaptured by the Sri Lanka Army in 1995 after a 50-day siege during Operation Riviresa. It was also vandalised by locals to rebuild houses damaged 
				  from the war . Today it remains garrisoned by a detachment of the Sri Lanka Army with limited access to visitors and is being renovated with Dutch funding.</p>

			<h4> 03. nagadipa purana Viharaya</h4>
			<img src="resources/northern/nagadipa-purana-vihara.jpg" alt="nagadipa" id="img" title="Nagadipa Purana Viharaya">
			<p>Nagadeepa Purana Vihara  is an ancient Buddhist temple situated in Jaffna district of Northern Province, Sri Lanka. It is among the country's sixteen holiest
				 Buddhist shrines (Solosmasthana).According to contemporary history, the Gautama Buddha visited the site after five years of attaining Enlightenment to settle
				  the dispute between two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara.

				Ancient history according to the Mahavamsa chronicles and the Tamil Buddhist epic Manimekalai mentions a gem-studded throne and a stone with the Buddha’s 
				footprint at the island Nainativu, (also known as Nagadeepa) which pilgrims from India visited.The site is known as the place where Lord Buddha came during 
				his second visit to Sri Lanka, after five years of attaining Enlightenment, to intervene and mediate in settling a dispute between two Naga Kings, Chulodara 
				and Mahodara over the possession of a gem-studded throne.Since the end of the war in 2009 the temple has rapidly grown to accommodate a massive number of pilgrims. 
				By 2010 the total pilgrims visiting the Temple combined with those of the Hindu Nallur Kovil in Jaffna, and the Catholic Madhu Marian shrine in Mannar was nearly 3 million.</p>

			<h4> 04. Sangupiddy Bridge</h4>
			<img src="resources/northern/Sangupiddy-Bridge.jpg" alt="Sangupiddy Bridge" id="img" title="Sangupiddy Bridge">
			<p>Sangupiddy Bridge (Changkupiddy Bridge) is a road bridge across Jaffna Lagoon in northern Sri Lanka. It connects Sangupiddy in Kilinochchi District to Karaitivu in Jaffna District.
				 It is one of only two road bridges connecting the densely populated Jaffna Peninsula with the mainland.In July 1932, during British colonial rule, plans were drawn up to build a 
				 causeway (the Mahadeva Causeway) across the shallow waters of the Jaffna lagoon, linking Sangupiddy, near Poonakari, with Karaitivu, near Navatkuly. The plans weren't implemented 
				 fully due to protests from local fishermen and salt producers. The partially built causeway was nevertheless used by locals until the civil war prevented them doing so.

				 In December 2009, following the end of the civil war, plans were drawn to build a bridge on the site of the causeway. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Ports and Highways had ordered
				  an Atlas type bridge from British company Mabey and Johnson for the flyover at the Panadura junction in Colombo but the bridge was instead used for the Sangupiddy Bridge. 
				  Construction began in April 2010, with erection of 7-span bridge commencing in September 2010. Construction was carried out by Access Engineering, a Sri Lankan company. The 
				  bridge was completed in eight months. The bridge was formally opened on 16 January 2011.</p>

			<h4> 05. Dambakola Patuna Sangamitta Temple</h4>
			<img src="Resources/northern/image.jpg" alt="Dambakola Patuna Sangamitta Temple" title="Dambakola Patuna Sangamitta Temple" id="img">
			<p>The Port of Jambukola or Dambakola Patuna is an ancient port to the north of Jaffna, in the Northern Province, Sri Lanka.
				After Mihindu Maha Thero brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka in 250BC, his sister, Theri Sanghamitta arrived in Sri Lanka with a Sacred Bo Sapling one year later to this port. The temple
				 Samudda-panasala (Jambukola Viharaya) was built commemorating the arrival of the Bo sapling by King Devanampiya Tissa (250-210 BC). Later, the same king planted one of the first
				  eight shoots of the Sri Maha Bodhi, on the same place where he kept the original tree before bringing it to Anuradhapura. King Vijayabahu I (1070–1110) has restored this site.
				   The remains of the vihara, such as the Buddha footprint stone and vatadage seen up to recent times no longer exist there.

This port gradually faded in importance while port Mahathiththa/ Mahathota/ Mantota (now Mantai) located at the mouth of Malvatu oya developed as a key intersection of sea-routes and the Dambakola
 Patuna Viharaya was lost in time. The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, the Mahavamsa and Samanthapaasasdika mention pilgrims coming from "Yonaka" country to Jambukola to worship the Jambukola Viharaya 
 in the ancient times.
