		<h4> 01. Ridi Viharaya</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north western/Ridi Viharaya.jpg" alt="Ridi Viharaya" title="Ridi Viharaya" id="img">
		<p>Ridi Viharaya  or Silver Temple is a 2nd-century BCE Theravada Buddhist temple in the village of Ridigama, Sri Lanka. Built during the reign of Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura,
			 the temple is considered as the place where the silver ore, which provided silver to complete Ruwanwelisaya; one of the largest stupa in Sri Lanka, was discovered. According 
			 to the chronicles Mahavamsa and Thupavamsa, the Ridi Viharaya complex was built in gratitude for helping him cherish his dream of completing Ruwanwelisaya.
			 Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, a Sinhalese king of ancient Sri Lanka, known for his campaign that defeated and overthrew the usurping Tamil prince Ellalan of Chola Kingdom,
			  reigned from 161 BCE to 137 BCE in the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Upon his victory over Elara, he initiated construction of Ruwanwelisaya, also known as the "Great Stupa", one of 
			  the tallest monuments built before the 20th century. Among other materials, silver was required for the basement of the stupa.There are approximately twenty-five caves around the 
			  temple, which are considered to be inhabited by Arhat monks, since the arrival of Arahat Mahinda in 3rd century BCE. The temple was revived in the 18th century CE, during the 
			  reign of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy (1746-1778 CE). Uda Viharaya was added to the complex during this period. Several affiliated devalas: Kumara Bandara Devalaya and Paththini 
			  Devalaya were also established. Ridi Viharaya now falls under the Malwatte chapter of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka.</p>

		<h4> 02. Sri Munneswaram Kovil</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north western/Munneswaram_Kovil_11.jpg" alt="Sri Munneswaram Kovil" title="Sri Munneswaram Kovil" id="img">
		<p>Munneswaram temple is an important regional Hindu temple complex in Sri Lanka. It has been in existence at least since 1000 CE although myths surrounding the temple associate it with
			 the popular Indian epic Ramayana, and its legendary hero-king Rama. The temple is one of the ancient Pancha Ishwarams dedicated to Shiva in the region.

			The temple complex is a collection of five temples, including a Buddhist temple. The central temple dedicated to Shiva (Siva) is the most prestigious and biggest, and is popular 
			amongst Hindus. The other temples are dedicated to Ganesha, Aiyanar and Kali. The Kali temple is also popular with Buddhists, who frequent the complex. Post-19th century, most of
			 the devotees of all temples in the complex belong to the majority Sinhala Buddhist ethnic group; the temples, excluding the Ayyanayake and the Buddhist temple, are administered by 
			 families belonging to the minority Hindu Tamils.
			
			The temple is located in Munneswaram, a village with mixed Sinhala and Tamil population situated in the historic Demala Pattuva ("Tamil division") region in the Puttalam District. 
			The main Shiva temple owns extensive property in the surrounding villages, ownership of which was affirmed when the region was part of the medieval Kotte Kingdom. The temple was
			 destroyed twice by the Portuguese colonial officers, who handed over the properties to the Jesuits. Although the Jesuits built a Catholic chapel over the temple foundation, locals 
			 reconstructed the temple both times. Due to religious and demographic change after the late 18th century, most surrounding villages and towns are not directly associated with the 
			 temple administration and maintenance.</p>

		<h4> 04. Yapahuwa Rock Fortress</h4>
		<img src="Resources/north western/Yapahuwa Rock Fortress.jpg" alt="Yapahuwa Rock Fortress" title="Yapahuwa Rock Fortress" id="img">
		<p>Yapahuwa was one of the ephemeral capitals of medieval Sri Lanka. The citadel of Yapahuwa lying midway between Kurunagala and Anuradhapura was built around a huge granite rock rising abruptly almost 
			a hundred meters above the surrounding lowlands.

			In 1272, King Bhuvenakabahu transferred the capital from Polonnaruwa to Yapahuwa in the face of Dravidian invasions from South India, bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic with him. Following the death of
			 King Bhuvenakabahu in 1284, the Pandyans of South India invaded Sri Lanka once again, and succeeded in capturing Sacred Tooth Relic. Following its capture, Yapahuwa was largely abandoned and 
			 inhabited by Buddhist monks and religious ascetics. The palace and fortress were built by King Buvanekabahu I (1272â€“1284) in the year 1273. Many traces of ancient battle defences can still be seen, 
			 while an ornamental stairway, is its biggest showpiece. On top of the rock are the remains of a stupa, a Bodhi tree enclosure, and a rock shelter/cave used by Buddhist monks, indicating that earlier
			  this site was used as a Buddhist monastery, like many boulders and hills in the area. There are several caves at the base of the rock. In one of them there is a shrine with Buddha images. One cave
			   has a Brahmi script inscription. At the southern base of the rock there is a fortification with two moats and ramparts. In this enclosure there are the remains of a number of buildings including a 
			   Buddhist shrine. There is also a Buddhist temple called Yapahuwa Rajamaha Vihara built during the Kandyan period.
