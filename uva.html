		<h4> 01. Adisham Bungalow</h4>
		<img src="Resources/uva/Adisham Bungalow.jpg" alt="Adisham Bungalow" title="Adisham Bungalow" id="img">
		<p>Adisham Hall, or Adisham Bungalow is a country house near Haputale, in the Badulla District, Sri Lanka. At present, it houses the Adisham monastery of Saint Benedict.
			 It has a relic (a chip of a bone) of St. Sylvester at the chapel. Sir Thomas Villiers was awarded 7 acres from the Tangamale Strict Nature Reserve by an act of the British 
			 parliament. The house was built in 1931 by an English aristocrat and planter Sir Thomas Villiers, former Chairman of George Steuart Co, a trading and estate agency based in Colombo.
			  Sir Thomas was a grandson of Lord John Russell and descendant of the Dukes of Bedford. Named after Adisham, it was designed by R. Booth and F. Webster in Tudor and Jacobean style.
			   Adisham Hall played host to many prominent personalities of the colony until the retirement of Sir Thomas, after which it was purchased by Don Charles Wijewardene and his daughter
			    Rukmini Wijewardene, owners of Sedawatte Estates, in 1950. While studying at LSE, London, Rukmini Wijewardene, in order to thank him for the sale, made a courtesy call on Sir Thomas 
				Villiers who was, by then, living in Knightsbridge, London. Don Charles and Rukmini were the husband and daughter of Vimala Wijewardene. In 1961 Rukmini Beligammana (née Wijewardene) 
				sold it to an Italian Benedictan monk. Upon purchasing the house and property the Italian monk removed silver cutlery and a few items of furniture in order to recover his investment 
				and also make a profit. After leaving it unoccupied for two years he subsequently donated the house and property to the Ampitiya Benedictine Monastery in 1963. The house is well 
				preserved along with its period fittings and furniture, and is open to visitors.</p>

		<h4> 02. Rawana Falls</h4>
		<img src="Resources/uva/Rawana Falls.jpg" alt="Rawana Falls" title="Rawana Falls" id="img">
		<p>Ravana Falls is a popular sightseeing attraction in Sri Lanka. It currently ranks as one of the widest falls in the country.
			This waterfall measures approximately 25 m (82 ft) in height and cascades from an oval-shaped concave rock outcrop. During the local wet season, the waterfall turns into what is said
			 to resemble an areca flower with withering petals. But this is not the case in the dry season, where the flow of water reduces dramatically. The falls form part of the Ravana Ella Wildlife
			  Sanctuary, and is located 6 km (3.7 mi) away from the local railway station at Ella. The falls have been named after the legendary king Ravana, which is connected to the famous Indian epic,
			   the Ramayana. According to legend, it is said that Ravana (who was the king of Sri Lanka at the time) had kidnapped princess Sita, and had hidden her in the caves behind this waterfall, now 
			   simply known as the Ravana Ella Cave. The reason for the kidnapping is said to be a revenge for slicing off the nose of his sister by Rama (husband of Sita) and his brother Laxmana. At the time, 
			   the cave was surrounded with thick forests in the midst of wilderness. It is also believed that Rama’s queen bathed in a pool that accumulated the water falling from this waterfall. They believed 
			   that Ravana has played the Ravanahatha over here.

		<h4> 03. Nine Arches Bridge</h4>
		<img src="Resources/uva/Nine Arches Bridge.jpg" alt="Nine Arches Bridge" title="Nine Arches Bridge" id="img">
		<p>The Nine Arch Bridge also called the Bridge in the Sky, is a viaduct bridge in Sri Lanka. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The construction of the
			 bridge is generally attributed to a local Ceylonese builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers. The chief designer and project manager of the 'upcountry railway line of 
			 Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway Construction Department of Ceylon
			  Government Railway. The 1923 report titled "Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon" published by the Engineering Association of Ceylon has details of all the records including the
			   plans and drawings. 

			It is located in Demodara, between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase of tourism due to the bridge's architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery
			 in the nearby hillsides.</p>

		<h4> 04. Mini Worlds End</h4>
		<img src="Resources/uva/Mini Worlds End.jpg" alt="Mini Worlds End" title="Mini Worlds End" id="img">
		<p>The Mini World’s End at Deanston is a spectacular view point located within the Knuckles Mountain Range. An escarpment with a sheer drop of 1192 metres, it gives magnificent and panoramic views of 
			the surrounding misty landscapes. Deanston, which is the starting point for the trail to Mini World’s End, is an off the beaten track of 1.1 kilometres towards the drop. One should not get confused 
			between the ‘Little World’s End’ located at Horton Plains and the Mini World’s End at Knuckles. It is referred to as ‘mini’ because the cliff is not as high as of the one at Horton Plains.
			The trail starts from the Knuckles conservation centre towards a little lake known as ‘Deanston Lake’, crossing a small bridge and you would reach the bank of the lake and turn to the right and walk
			 along the bank for about 10 metres till you reach a patch of forest and continue walking for a further 50 metres till you come to a wooden fence. Walk over the fence and ascend up some steps uphill
			  towards some pine trees and approach a circular trail. Take the left turn leading you through a trail of many elevations till you come to another left turn known as the Hapugaskumbara Nature Trail
			   that will ascend for about 100 metres till the terrain becomes flat. As you proceed further along the trail you will come across an area which has mixed trees of pines and other species. You will
			    have to climb some rocky steps till you arrive at the edge of the cliff. Turn left and walk a further 30 metres until you reach a rocky edge where you could walk right up to the edge which is the 
				Mini World’s End.</p>

		<h4> 05. Udawalawe National Park</h4>
		<img src="Resources/uva/Udawalawe National Park.jpg" alt="Udawalawe National Park" title="Udawalawe National Park" id="img">
		<p>Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka. The park was created to provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction of
			 the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve covers 30,821 hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June 1972.

			Before the designation of the national park, the area was used for shifting cultivation (chena farming). The farmers were gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is 165
			 kilometres (103 mi) from Colombo. Udawalawe is an important habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited park in the country.
			 Udawalawe lies on the boundary of Sri Lanka's wet and dry zones. Plains dominate the topography, though there are also some mountainous areas. The Kalthota Range and Diyawini Falls are in the 
			 north of the park and the outcrops of Bambaragala and Reminikotha lie within it. The park has an annual rainfall of 1,500 millimetres (59 in), most of which falls during the months of October 
			 to January and March to May. </p>
